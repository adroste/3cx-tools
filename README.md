# Do you want to take it over?

Please open an issue if you want to take this repo over and adjust it to the current version, add new stuff etc.

# No longer maintained

I tried to hack 3CX in so many ways because it did not fit my use cases that I finally decided to move away from it.

I switched to FreePBX 16 and I am really happy with it.
The interface is not as shiny as the one from 3CX but it can do so much more, e.g. different ringtones per line, proper dial codes, working fax etc.

The only thing that it is missing is a proper calls panel (like this one) and contacts management. Therefore I forked this repo and created a nice and shiny FreePBX module here: https://github.com/adroste/freepbx-realtime-calls-contacts-panel

If you also want to try out FreePBX I recommend the official image. If you want to use a Raspberry Pi don't want your time with raspbx and visit https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r30661088-PBX-FreePBX-for-the-Raspberry-Pi instead.

Feel free to use, fork, modify any of this. *Happy Hacking!*

*I do not intend to archive this repo right now as the code is working perfectly fine with v16 and I'm open for handing it over to someone else. The dialcode api was a pretty awesome idea...*
